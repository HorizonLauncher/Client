Hi there! Thanks for your interest in the localization files for Horizon Launcher. We use a free service called [OneSky](http://horizon.oneskyapp.com/collaboration/project?id=111884) to translate our client and other services. We then, after the translations are approved and reviewed, add support for them into the client.

If you would like to help translate the client or other Horizon Launcher services, **you must use the OneSky service**. Any PRs relating to edits to translations or new support for languages will be closed.

If you have any questions, feel free to join our Slack by using the badge above or [joining here](http://slack.launchhorizon.com). We also have an IRC channel (#launchhorizon) on Freenode.net.
